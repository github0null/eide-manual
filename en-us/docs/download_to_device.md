# Flash Program ðŸ’¾

> Note: You may need to set the installation path for some flasher. If the installation path is set to empty, the plug-in will search the environment variable for the location of its executable file.

## Install Flasher

Eide supports a variety of flash tools, but these tools are not integrated into the eide installation package, so you will need to install the appropriate flash tools before using the flash function.

There are two installation methods: **automatic installation** and **manual installation**

### Automatic Installation

Click the download button to trigger the download. Eide will check whether the corresponding flash tool has been installed. If the flash tool is not found, a prompt box will pop up indicating whether to install it.

![](../img/auto_install_flasher.png)

### Manual Installation

Download the corresponding flash tool and set the corresponding path in **plug-in Settings**.

How to do it ? See this section for a description of each flash tool.

## **Custom Flash Command**

> If you want to use another program that supports the command line, you can use the `custom shell command` to flash

### Usage

Click first to switch the flash tool to shell, as shown below

![](../img/uploader_cus.png)

Then modify the `command line` property and fill in the corresponding command for the burn tool you want to use

The command line supports some variables, such as:

- `${programFile}`: Program file path (`.hex, .bin, .s19`)

- `${port}`: `Available serialport` (**Note: If more than one serial port is available, this value is the first in the list of serial ports**)

### Example

> Tip: The flash software executable file path in the example command has been set to an environment variable

```bash
# Use NuLink to flash nuvoton mcu
NuLink -w APROM "${programFile}"

# Use stcflash flash 8051 mcu
python ./tools/stcflash.py -p ${port} "${programFile}"

# Use STM32CubeProgramer + STLink flash STM32
STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=SWD FREQ=4000 mode=NORMAL reset=SWrst --download "${programFile}" -v --go

# Use STM32CubeProgramer + STLink And through the external loading algorithm to burn the program to STM32H750 QSPI Flash
STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=SWD FREQ=4000 mode=NORMAL reset=SWrst -el ./STM32H7xx_W25Q128_WeAct.stldr --download "${programFile}" -v --go
```
